# <Levansportfolio>

## Description

My first ever code written from scratch creating my portfolio for future purposes. Working on this project helped me understand structure and functions of html and css better.


## Usage

This webpage includes information about me, link to my deployed webpage and different ways to contact me. If you click navigation links it will take you to the corresponding section. Adapted with various screen sizes and devices.
