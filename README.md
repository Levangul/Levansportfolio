# <Levansportfolio>

## Description

My first ever code written from scratch creating my own portfolio for future purposes. Working on this project helped me understand structure and functions of html and css better.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
